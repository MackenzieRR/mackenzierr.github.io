<h2>MJARR</h2>
  <p class="bio">Mackenzie J.A. Reid Rostad (b. 1995) is a Canadian documentary filmmaker with a practice of participatory and lighthearted explorations of the abstractions that comprise everyday life. Originally from Vancouver, after completing his BFA at Simon Fraser University in 2017 he relocated to Montréal. There he made his first mid-length documentary Goodnight Goodnight (2020)—a film about love and hydroelectricity—which premiered at Visions du Réel in Nyon, Switzerland, and won the national shorts competition at RIDM in Montréal. He later moved to Europe and began working on Kingdom, Clouds, Sirens, Pirates, and Dream Sheets (2021), which explored his attempted move to the city of Berlin. The film was completed during his short stay in London, United Kingdom, which also yielded a series of correspondence films about Grenfell Tower and Notting Hill as part of the Dear Kristina series (2020-2021). Mackenzie is a co-creator of the counter film festival Barlinale in Berlin and an active member of the Cinema Nova collective in Brussels, where he is currently based.
