       <p> At the roots of a region's network of public transportation rests ‘SkyTrain’. True to its name, the system is elevated above street level and remains segregated by design. Piloted by computers, the fleet of autonomous trains has continued to connect communities since its inception. The futuristic system, in conjunction with the opening of its newest extension, has recently become the longest fully automated driverless system in the world. ‘This Place, Here’ explores the subsurface origins of this social system.
